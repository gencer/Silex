Dave [suggested the same fix](https://github.com/davedevelopment/Silex/compare/alternative-request-context-fix).

I specifically avoided this because extending a data structure with behaviour seems messy. After giving it more thought I think this is probably an acceptable fix after all.

But I still think it should be in Symfony's RequestContext directly, instead of forcing everyone to hack around this bug.

Worked well for me.
