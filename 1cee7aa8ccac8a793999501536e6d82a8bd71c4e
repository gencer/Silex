I'm trying to reduce the build matrix but I don't understand how it works. Anyone?

@fabpot There is 2 ways to define a simpler build matrix:

- define the build matrix only based on the PHP version (for a single Symfony version), and then include extra jobs in the matrix through the ``include`` config
- define the build matrix with version+env and then exclude all the jobs we don't want.

The issue is that currently, you are mixing both. You are using env+version and then including extra jobs.
I suggest using ``include`` to add the config for extra versions. It will require less combinations than excluding all jobs we don't want if we want to keep a single job per extra Symfony version.

See https://github.com/Behat/MinkBrowserKitDriver/blob/master/.travis.yml for the way I did it in other repos

thanks @stof, looks much better now.

it might be worth fixing the coding standards in Silex to avoid unrelated fabbot failures in future PRs
