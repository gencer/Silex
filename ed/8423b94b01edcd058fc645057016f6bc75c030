I'm not really sure, but I think this would fix another problem I had with the Translation service provider. I didn't have `symfony/config` in my project and I didn't want to use Xliff files. But perhaps because of that it tried to always add a Xliff resource which resulted in that the XML reader was not available. Requiring `symfony/config` fixed the problem, but it was not needed otherwise.

That's weird...the files it wants should be with the component. Did you override the translator closure and not add xliff loader? I wonder if that should be checked too before adding the resource, although we don't have access to the loaders at that point.

Looks good to me. Can you add a test?

How are these?

Tests do not pass according to Travis and it seems related to your changes.

Oh I didn't think about other versions of the translation component

That fixed it. Looks like there's just deprecation warnings on 2.7 build.
