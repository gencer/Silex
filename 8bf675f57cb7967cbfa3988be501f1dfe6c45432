If this is included with silex, then the factory should be a service registered by the `ValidatorServiceProvider`. `$validators` should be set from a `validator.validator_service_ids` container parameter.

you should also provide unit tests.

And the security service provider should register the validator for the UserPassword constraint once you update the ValidatorServiceProvider and both are registered

 @igorw @stof good points. Will modify accordingly.

@igorw @stof what do you guys think? @stof I'm not sure how to implement the UserPassword feature that you asked.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@alexkappa When the Validator and the Security providers are both registered, the UserPasswordValidator should be registered as a service and added in ``validator.validator_service_ids``
