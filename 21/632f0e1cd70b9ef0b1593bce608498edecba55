I updated the code and added some tests to cover this new feature as you suggested @fabpot. Do you think the tests provide enough coverage?

@stof, this PR does not solve my use case directly, but using it to have `Silex` use a subclass of Symfony's `RouteCollection` like [this one](https://github.com/lschricke/symfony-strict-route-collection) seems to work in my tests. Am I missing something?
