P.S. Sorry for all the PRs, silex is my chosen target for the 24 pull requests thing this week :)

@davedevelopment That's great! No worries.

By the way, 1.2 is still maintained, so I think most of your PRs should target 1.2 instead of master.

However, for the 1.2 branch, it will need to say ``composer require silex/silex "~1.2"`` explicitly (so that it does not install 2.0)

Hmm, I don't really know what's best. The purpose of the README in a master branch that is unstable is unclear to me. Should it be relevant to the latest stable release (because it's the first thing people see when they see the repo), or should it be relevant to the branch. My preference would be for the branch.

I've just changed the default branch to 1.2 on Github.

So if I push a commit to this PR to specify "~2.0@dev", then create another PR that targets the 1.2 branch with

``` bash
php composer.phar require silex/silex "~1.2"
```

That will cover everything and be simple enough, right?
