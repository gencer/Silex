That can only be merged in the master branch.

Yes, that's my bad. Shall I close this request and open the new one for master commit then?

@lokhman No, I can merge this PR directly into master.

@fabpot Brilliant, thanks! Will it be possible to make `$type` argument coming first at some point in the future release? I personally find it rather important when extending `form.types` with own forms.
