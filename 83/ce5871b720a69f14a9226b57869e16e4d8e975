Would it makes sense to instead use `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder`? Or at least add a sensible configuration for it by default in the provider?

@fabpot I don't have enough knowledge to argue for bcrypt or pbkdf2 but [the php documentation on hash_pbkdf2](php.net/hash_pbkdf2) says :
>  The PBKDF2 method can be used for hashing passwords for storage. However, it should be noted that password_hash() or crypt() with CRYPT_BLOWFISH are better suited for password storage.

But yes, a `security.encoder.pbkdf2` could be added as it's also widely used

@e-moe what do you think ?

@mathroc I'm not a security expert either. But I would say let's give users possibility to choose. I will update my pull request
