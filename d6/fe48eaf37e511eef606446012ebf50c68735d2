A symfony 2.3 is supposed to keep BC, can we only require `~2.3` ?

I've updated the PR according to @lyrixx and @davedevelopment comments

@lyrixx what does the LTS have to do with `~2.3`? Once you use `~`, you're assuming that later versions don't break BC at all, or that silex will support any future version of symfony 2.x (with adding in hacks if needed). IMO silex *should* be bounded, and the supported symfony versions *should* be explicit.

I think @lyrixx was getting at...

> So, except when fixing a security issue, we must not break backward compatibility anymore after Symfony 2.3 and until Symfony 3.0.

.. but I'm with Igor, I'd rather we keep on as we are for now.

@igorw I did not talk about LTS ;) And @davedevelopment got the point.

The previous version was better. We consciously made the decision to limit our support in Silex instead of trusting Symfony BC policy ;)
