The Silex master branch currently depends on Symfony 2.7+. The easiest would probably to make it require 2.8+ instead, allowing to use only the new APIs.

:+1:  thanks, got these issues as well with the latest Silex version.

Is there anything else that needs to be done here? Does this need to be rebased off of master before we can merge in?

As 2.8 is a LTS, I'm going to remove support for 2.7 in Silex 2.0. That could make things easier for everyone.

This one can be merged after #1338
