I fixed the build failure. Would be happy to get any feedback here.

how could Silex 2 lack a RequestStack ? The only case where Silex 1 lacks it is when installing HttpFoundation 2.3 AFAIK, and Silex 2 requires Symfony 2.7+

Well in Cilex you don't register the HttpKernelServiceProvider and you run into issues.

Is this one a problem for Cilex? 588c52a

Well no defining debug is alright, that's easy to do if it's not done by default (not sure anymore if it is, but I have it set..), the request_stack on the other hand is kinda problematic because that's something you really don't need in a CLI context
