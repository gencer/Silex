This is a bit complex.

We coulf simplify usage of cache for class metadata by creating a service serializer.cache that is null by default.

I agree.
Do you have the time to make the necessary changes?

@SpacePossum, Ok, you're right.
Any subjection to merge this? It will improve the documentation showing how to better setup serializer. Or maybe should I write something more simple?

Your docs helped me to get things going faster, however I've no powers here (to merge) :)

Ok, I will wait for someone to merge it.
